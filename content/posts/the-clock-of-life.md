My last post was about *how* to move forward. Stay vigilant, keep learning. But it left a deeper question: where am I moving? Why?

Trying to answer that here.

## The question

Why isn't happiness forever?

Every peak I've reached—career wins, relationships clicking, health good—life pulls me back down. Not dramatically. Just... inevitably.

Couldn't stop thinking about it. Led me to this framework. The Clock of Life.

## The clock

Life as a circle. Four phases. We move through them constantly.

**Right (3 o'clock): Suffering & Pain.** The winter. Loss, failure, things falling apart. Hurts. But clears ground.

**Top (12 o'clock): Effort & Struggle.** The climb. You identified a problem, now you work on it. Hard work, deliberate practice, pushing through. Most of productive life is here.

**Left (9 o'clock): Happiness & Flow.** The harvest. Everything clicks. You're in flow. Feeling *right*. Beautiful. But temporary.

**Bottom (6 o'clock): Curiosity & Exploration.** The packing. Happiness fades, but pain hasn't arrived yet. You wander. Follow random interests. No clear goal. Feels unproductive. Seeds get planted here.

## How we move

Pain → Effort: Something breaks. Relationship ends, health fails, project dies. You can't stay there. So you start working on it.

Effort → Happiness: The work pays off. Suddenly things click. You're not grinding anymore, you're flowing.

Happiness → Curiosity: The high fades. Not because something went wrong. Just... normalizes. You start wondering what else is out there. Exploring without pressure.

Curiosity → Pain: You've been wandering. Maybe too long. Something you neglected catches up. Or life just throws something at you. Back to winter.

Pain and happiness are brief. Most of life is effort and curiosity.

Different areas of life have different clocks. Different speeds. Your work clock at 12, relationship clock at 3.

## Where I've been

Five years stuck between 3 and 12. Pain and effort. Grinding, burning out, recovering just enough to grind again. Clock wasn't moving. Oscillating.

Then Claude Code happened.

First time in years, landed at 9. Flow. Joy. Work felt effortless. Building things. Contributing to projects I cared about. The harvest after five years of winter and climbing.

Now drifting toward 6. Curiosity. Pressure's off. Exploring ideas. No specific goals. Wondering what's next.

## The conversation

My girlfriend is Thai. Buddhist. Threw my whole framework into question.

I was explaining the clock. How the goal is to keep it moving. Accept the phases. Push through the hard parts.

She said: "Or step into the center."

## The center

Buddhist monks don't move around the clock. They aim for the middle. No movement.

Means giving up not just suffering but happiness too. No hot showers savored. No dancing. No riding the high of a good day.

Just existing. Equilibrium.

Seemed like giving up at first. Why avoid *joy*?

But there's something to it. From the center, you're not pulled by desire. Not pushed by pain. Not chasing the next phase. Not dreading this one.

Just here.

## Two paths

**Capitalist path: Keep spinning.** Daniel Roe's view—effort is the golden thread. Growth requires struggle. Life without problems isn't life. Just time. Meaning is in the movement.

**Buddhist path: Find stillness.** Don't cycle through phases. Step off the wheel. Goal isn't better phases. It's no phases.

## What I think

Both right.

Capitalist path gives growth. Meaning. Full human experience. You feel everything. Build things. Connect deeply.

Buddhist path offers something else: peace that doesn't depend on circumstances. Rest that isn't just recovery for the next grind.

Question isn't "move or don't move."

It's: can I choose?

Push the clock when it's time to grow. Step into center when stillness is what I need. Stop treating effort as the only valid state.

Don't have this figured out. Girlfriend meditates. I check my phone too much. She's comfortable with stillness. I get restless after an hour.

But talking to her showed me something. The center isn't failure. Isn't giving up. It's a real option.

## Now

Clock at 6. Curiosity. Exploration.

First time I'm not anxious to push it back to 12. Not rushing toward the next grind.

Maybe that's the lesson. Clock keeps moving whether I push or not. Job isn't to spin it faster.

It's to pay attention to where I am.

And occasionally, step into the center.
